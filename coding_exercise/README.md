### PyTorch
#### Lesson 1. Intro to PyTorch
In thi lesson, we learnt the basic syntax of tensor operations in PyTorch. Importantly, the 8 `Ipython` teaches the forward & backward propagations, training neural networks, inference/validations, saving and loading models. 

The applications includes two Digit-MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Cat-Dog-Classification. At the end, we will use the popular pretrained neural network and transfer it to the Cat-Dog-Classification problem. 

To run with the 8 exercises, cpu is enough for reasonable training and testing. To play with the Cat-Dog-Classification task, we need to download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
